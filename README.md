# PSAdminConsole
> PeopleSoft Admin Console - Powershell control of multiple Windows PeopleSoft Application / Process Scheduler / Web servers
  
Issue: I have a number of Windows servers to support and manage and wanted a quick way to interrogate the status of the state of the app servers.
  
Solution: I built a Powershell script to remotely invoke the psadmin executable and look at the application server status...and what I've put up here is the result of me adding bits and bats...
  
Installation: If you grab all the files and folders in the src and run the PSAdminConsole.ps1, if you get to see the GUI then you can open the help file and it'll give you an idea on how to proceed.
  
There's a bit more info on my blog https://mrcmonkey.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/psadmin-console.html
